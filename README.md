# Cache

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/desarrolla2/Cache.png)](http://travis-ci.org/desarrolla2/Cache)

A symple cache library. Implements different adapters that you can use and change 
easily by a manager or similar.


## Installation

### With Composer

It is best installed it through [packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/desarrolla2/cache) 
by including
`desarrolla2/cache` in your project composer.json require:

``` json
    "require": {
        // ...
        "desarrolla2/cache":  "dev-master"
    }
```

### Without Composer

You can also download it from [Github] (https://github.com/desarrolla2/Cache), 
but no autoloader is provided so you'll need to register it with your own PSR-0 
compatible autoloader.

## Usage


``` php
    <?php

    use Desarrolla2\Cache\Cache;
    use Desarrolla2\Cache\Adapter\NotCache;

    $cache = new Cache(new NotCache());

    $cache->set('key', 'myKeyValue', 3600);

    // later ...

    echo $cache->get('key');

```

## Adapters

### NotCache

Use it if you will not implement any cache adapter is an adapter that will serve 
to fool the test environments.

### File

Use it if you will you have dont have other cache system available in your system
or if you like to do your code more portable.

``` php
    <?php
    
    use Desarrolla2\Cache\Cache;
    use Desarrolla2\Cache\Adapter\File;


    $adapter = new File();
    $adapter->setOption('ttl', 3600);
    $adapter->setOption('cacheDir', '/tmp');
    $cache = new Cache($adapter);

```

### Apc

Use it if you will you have APC cache available in your system.

``` php
    <?php
    
    use Desarrolla2\Cache\Cache;
    use Desarrolla2\Cache\Adapter\Apc;


    $adapter = new Apc();
    $adapter->setOption('ttl', 3600);
    $cache = new Cache($adapter);

```

## Coming soon

This library implements other adapters as soon as possible, feel free to send 
new adapters if you think it appropriate.

This can be a list of pending tasks.

* MemcachedAdapter
* Other Adapters
* More test
